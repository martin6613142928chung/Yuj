Rotating 3D Torus Fractals (R3TF), is a mathematical computer model software of the Universe that unifies general relativity and the quantum mechanics of the fundamental forces of nature in a Theory of Everything.   

It allows the user to toggle the various parameters of the mathematical architecture to see that this Theory of Everything is correct.   

The naturally, neutral, supersymmetrical, null, mathematical Universe architecture, is exponentially/elliptically energised to feature everything in varying degrees of materiality and spirituality.   

>Spiritual: virtual, subatomic matter, or spacetime vacuum, or radiation energy, or gravitational wave, or 'dark matter'  

>Material: macro, real, massive, particle matter  Everything's material-spiritual being is in a state of dynamic equilibriums (infinity), whereby everything interacts with one another via their spiritual aspects.  

Rotating 3D Torus Fractals (R3TF), unifies everything in terms of the various equilibrium states of massive matter and energetic forces, or E ∞ mc² and F ∞ ma, colloquially known as the God equation.
